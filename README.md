# Pandora-s-Newb-Box

Hello anyone who's reading this
I've never coded in my life outside of high school, and even then I can't remember anything I did
But I'm curious, I saw Codecamp being brought up on Quora multiple times
Sounds good, now I'm here and hopefully I'll learn something
And who knows where I'll take it from there
